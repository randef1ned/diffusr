Description: Implementation of network diffusion algorithms such as
  heat diffusion or Markov random walks. Network diffusion algorithms generally
  spread information in the form of node weights along the edges of a graph to other nodes.
  These weights can for example be interpreted as temperature, an initial amount
  of water, the activation of neurons in the brain, or the location of a random
  surfer in the internet. The information (node weights) is iteratively propagated
  to other nodes until a equilibrium state or stop criterion occurs.
